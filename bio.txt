# Personal Bio

## Why HR Tech & Data Science?
My journey is unique because I sit at the intersection of **Talent Acquisition** and **Advanced AI**. [cite_start]During my time at **Cielo Talent**, I saw the "Insight Gap" firsthand—HR teams have data but lack the coding skills to use it[cite: 15, 142]. [cite_start]This inspired my MSc dissertation, where I am building an **LLM-driven Agent** that allows non-technical users to run complex ML models using natural language[cite: 144, 166].

## Professional Philosophy
[cite_start]I follow a **Pragmatist** philosophy—data science tools must work in the real world to solve actual business problems[cite: 195]. I don't just build models for accuracy; [cite_start]I build them for **Utility** and **Explainability** (using tools like SHAP), ensuring that stakeholders trust the AI's decisions[cite: 216, 246].

## Core Competencies
* **Hybrid Skillset:** I can recruit (HR domain knowledge) and I can code (Python/AI).
* [cite_start]**GenAI Native:** Deep experience with **LangChain**, **RAG**, and **Agentic Workflows**[cite: 144].
* [cite_start]**Ethical AI:** Strong focus on algorithmic fairness, GDPR compliance, and removing bias from automated decision-making[cite: 237, 242].
