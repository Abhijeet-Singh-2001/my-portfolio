# Projects & Research

## 1. LLM-Driven AutoML for Attrition Prediction (MSc Dissertation)
* **Role:** Researcher & Developer
* [cite_start]**Objective:** Developed a "Virtual Data Scientist" artifact to democratize predictive analytics for HR managers, addressing the "Insight Gap" in Human Resources[cite: 142, 144].
* [cite_start]**Tech Stack:** Python, **LangChain**, **PyCaret (AutoML)**, **Streamlit**, OpenAI API, SMOTE[cite: 170, 225].
* **Methodology:**
    * [cite_start]**Architecture:** Built an Agentic RAG workflow where an LLM interprets natural language queries from HR managers and triggers AutoML pipelines[cite: 144, 178].
    * [cite_start]**Data:** Trained on the Saudi Employee Attrition Dataset ($N=1,191$), handling class imbalance using SMOTE[cite: 184, 209].
    * [cite_start]**Modeling:** Optimized an ensemble of Gradient Boosting models (XGBoost, CatBoost) to achieve a target **Recall of >85%** to minimize costly false negatives[cite: 147, 182].
    * [cite_start]**Explainability:** Integrated **SHAP** (Shapley Additive Explanations) to provide transparency and ensure GDPR compliance regarding automated decision-making[cite: 148, 233].

## 2. Credit Card Fraud Detection (Capstone)
* [cite_start]**Objective:** Built a fraud detection system on highly imbalanced financial data[cite: 61, 66].
* [cite_start]**Tech Stack:** Python, Scikit-Learn, Random Forest, XGBoost, SMOTE[cite: 24, 66].
* **Key Outcome:** Achieved high recall using cost-sensitive learning techniques to minimize financial loss from missed fraud cases. [cite_start]Utilized SHAP for feature importance[cite: 68, 69].

## 3. Healthcare NLP - Named Entity Recognition (NER)
* [cite_start]**Objective:** Extract medical entities (diseases, treatments, medications) from unstructured clinical text[cite: 27, 79].
* [cite_start]**Tech Stack:** SpaCy, CRF Models, Regex[cite: 80].
* [cite_start]**Outcome:** Standardized clinical data to aid decision-making systems[cite: 81].

## 4. Telecom Churn Prediction
* [cite_start]**Objective:** Predict customer churn and identify key drivers of attrition[cite: 25, 71].
* [cite_start]**Tech Stack:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees[cite: 71].
* [cite_start]**Outcome:** Identified tenure and contract type as major churn drivers and recommended retention strategies to improve Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)[cite: 72, 73].
